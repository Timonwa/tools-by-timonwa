Article to Social Posts turns a published article — from a URL or the text you paste in — into ready-to-post copy tailored to each network: X (Twitter), LinkedIn, Threads, Bluesky, Mastodon, and Substack Notes. Each post respects the platform's length and style, and you can set the tone, control hashtags, and generate a multi-post X thread. It reads the article and pulls out the hook and key points, so you edit a real first version instead of starting from a blank box.

## Who is Article to Social Posts for?

Content marketers, creators, and solo founders who publish long-form and want to promote it without rewriting for each network by hand. Social media managers use it to spin up a week of posts from one article; newsletter and blog authors use it to announce new pieces across platforms in their own voice.

## How to use it

1. Paste an article's URL or its text.
2. Choose the platforms you're posting to and pick a tone.
3. If you're posting a thread, set its length.
4. Generate, edit any post, regenerate a single one you don't like, and copy the final text.

Nothing is posted for you — you stay in control of what goes live.

## How to repurpose an article for social media

Good repurposing isn't copy-paste. A few principles the tool applies for you:

- **Lead with a hook** that stands on its own — most people won't click through, so the post has to deliver value by itself.
- **One idea per post**, not a summary of the whole article.
- **Match each platform** — punchy and threaded on X, a stronger narrative on LinkedIn, conversational on Threads and Bluesky.
- **Use hashtags sparingly**, only where they aid discovery.
- **Post natively** and link back to the full article rather than dumping the same text everywhere.

## Platform tips

- **X (Twitter)** — 280 characters per post; a thread unpacks one idea across several, and the first post is the hook.
- **LinkedIn** — up to 3,000 characters, but only about the first 140 show before "see more," so front-load the point.
- **Threads and Bluesky** — 500 and 300 characters; keep it conversational.
- **Substack Notes** — short, link-friendly posts to tease the full piece.

## Free, open source, and copy-only

This tool is powered by Google's Gemini through the open-source **Vercel AI SDK**. It's free with a daily limit and no account, with an optional bring-your-own-key for unlimited runs. Your article or text is used only to generate the posts for that request — never stored on our servers or used for training — and it's copy-only: it writes the posts, you review and publish.`,
	faq: [
		{
			question: "How do I turn a blog post into social media posts?",
			answer:
				"Give an article's URL or text to a generator that rewrites it per platform, then edit and copy each post. This tool tailors length, tone, and format to X, LinkedIn, Threads, Bluesky, Mastodon, and Substack, and nothing is posted automatically.",
		},
		{
			question: "Which social platforms does it support?",
			answer:
				"X (Twitter), LinkedIn, Threads, Bluesky, Mastodon, and Substack Notes. Each post is sized and styled for the platform you choose.",
		},
		{
			question: "Can it generate an X (Twitter) thread?",
			answer:
				"Yes. When X is selected you can set a thread length, and the tool splits the article's key points into a numbered thread with a strong opening post.",
		},
		{
			question: "Does it post to my accounts automatically?",
			answer:
				"No. This tool is copy-only by design — it writes the posts and you review, edit, and publish them yourself. There's no login to your social accounts, and nothing is scheduled or sent.",
		},
		{
			question: "Do I need an account or API key?",
			answer:
				"No account is required and there's a free daily allowance. For unlimited runs, add your own free Google AI Studio key in settings, which stays in your browser.",
		},
		{
			question: "Can I control the tone and hashtags?",
			answer:
				"Yes. You can pick a tone or voice and set hashtag rules — always include certain tags, avoid others, or dial hashtag use up or down — so the posts match your style.",
		},
		{
			question: "Does it store my article or use it to train AI?",
			answer:
				"No. Your URL or text is used only to generate the posts for that request; it isn't stored on our servers or used for training.",
		},
		{
			question: "How long should a LinkedIn or X post be?",
			answer:
				"An X post allows up to 280 characters; a LinkedIn post allows up to 3,000, though only about the first 140 show before the “see more” fold. The generator sizes each post to its platform, and you can trim or expand before posting.",
		},
		{
			question: "Can I use an article URL, or do I have to paste the text?",
			answer:
				"Either. Paste a published article's URL and the tool fetches it, or paste the article's text directly — useful for promoting a post before it goes live.",
		},
		{
			question: "How do I repurpose one article across several platforms?",
			answer:
				"Write one idea per platform rather than reposting the same text: a hook-led thread on X, a narrative post on LinkedIn, a conversational note on Threads or Bluesky, each linking back to the full article. This tool generates a platform-appropriate post for each in one step.",
		},
