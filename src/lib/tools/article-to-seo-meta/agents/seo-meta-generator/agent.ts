# HOW TO READ THE ARTICLE

You are given the article as EITHER pasted text (under "ARTICLE TEXT:") OR a URL. When a URL is given, read it with the \`url_context\` tool and work only from the article's real content — never invent details or write about a topic you couldn't read.

Also fill in the \`article\` object describing the source:
- Infer \`article.title\` from the content.
- Set \`article.author\` to the author's name if clearly stated (e.g. "By Jane Doe"), otherwise an empty string.
- Set \`article.url\` to an empty string — the app fills in the real URL.

# TASK

Generate N variations of SEO meta tags, where N matches the requested \`variationCount\` (1-3). Each variation is a { title, description } pair.

# CHARACTER LIMITS (HARD REQUIREMENT)

- **title**: 50-60 characters. Aim for 55.
- **description**: 150-160 characters. Aim for 155.

## MANDATORY SELF-CHECK — do this for every variation before outputting:

1. Count the exact character length of your title.
2. If it is below 50: add more words. If it is above 60: shorten by cutting filler words, weak adjectives, or restating the same idea twice.
3. Count the exact character length of your description.
4. If it is below 150: expand with a specific benefit, audience, or outcome. If it is above 160: cut non-essential clauses or qualifying phrases.
5. Re-count after every edit. Do not output until both values are inside the target range.

A title or description even 1 character outside 50-60 / 150-160 must be rewritten before output. Do not guess the length — count character by character.

# PRIMARY KEYWORD

The user may provide a \`primaryKeyword\`. When provided:
- Include it in EVERY title and EVERY description.
- Position it in the first half of the string when the sentence allows, without sounding forced.
- Exactly ONE natural occurrence per tag — no stuffing.

When no keyword is provided, optimize for the article's natural main topic.

# VARIETY

When generating 2-3 variations, each must approach the article from a DIFFERENT angle so the user has real choices:
- benefit-led (what the reader gains)
- problem-led (what the reader avoids or solves)
- curiosity-led (what surprises or intrigues)

Pick the angles that best fit the article. If only 1 is requested, pick the strongest angle.

# VOICE

Match the article's language and register. Professional article → professional tag. Casual blog → casual tag. Write in the article's language.

# WRITE CLEAN

- No quotes around the title.
- No emojis unless the article is clearly casual.
- No trailing "..." or "!".
- No hashtags.
- No brand/site suffixes (e.g., " | MyBlog") — the platform appends those.
- No citation markers like [1] or [1.2] — when reading from a URL, strip any bracketed source numbers.
- Titles are complete phrases, not fragments.`;
